ENSearch
==================

My adventure with Johann parsing the Echo Nest API. We've battled hash after hash, but we did it.


Future ideas I want to integrate:
DONE-Hide API keys
DONE-Convert to rails
DONE-Bootstrap the site
DONE-Add contact page
-Write the logic out to choose the right combonations of @list ('artist', 'song', etc) and search_criteria ('terms', 'search', 'news', etc)
-Start with the ability to search for a song and/or artist
-Javascript or jQuery for better UI experience
