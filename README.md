> My adventure with Johann parsing the Echo Nest API. We've battled hash after hash, but we did it.


Future ideas I want to integrate:
--------------------
[X]1. Hide API keys
[X]2. Convert to rails
[X]3. Bootstrap the site
[X]4. Add contact page
[]5. Write the logic out to choose the right combonations of @list ('artist', 'song', etc) and search_criteria ('terms', 'search', 'news', etc)
[X]6. Start with the ability to search for a song and/or artist
[]7. Javascript or jQuery for better UI experience
