ENSearch
==================
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/neilnorthrop/ENSearch.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/neilnorthrop/ENSearch)

> My adventure with Johann parsing the Echo Nest API. We've battled hash after hash, but we did it.


Future ideas I want to integrate:
--------------------
1. DONE Hide API keys
2. DONE Convert to rails
3. DONE Bootstrap the site
4. DONE Add contact page
5. Write the logic out to choose the right combonations of @list ('artist', 'song', etc) and search_criteria ('terms', 'search', 'news', etc)
6. DONE Start with the ability to search for a song and/or artist
7. Javascript or jQuery for better UI experience
